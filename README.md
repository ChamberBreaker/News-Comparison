ChamberBreaker was borne out of a desire to knock down the existing social and mainstream media echo chambers.

On a daily basis, our Twitter, FaceBook, Instagram, and our preferred news outlets generally serve to reinforce our existing worldview.

This constant confirmation bias has a polarizing effect. We become less attune to opposing ideas and more entrenched in our thinking.

ChamberBreaker provides an easy way to compare news coverage. Simply select a news topic, and compare news coverage for yourself.

Get a more robust understanding of what people from both political parties are reading. With a better understanding of the spectrum of
news coverage, we hope that we can facilitate better discussion and bipartisan collaboration.

Break down your echo chamber with ChamberBreaker.
